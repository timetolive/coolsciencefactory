          Our goal is to establish a win-win relationship with our clients by establishing long-term 
          partnerships based on trust.  Our clients expect us to understand their goals, not just carry out
          instructions, and to make their budgets and schedules a priority.  Our partnership model is 
          designed to establish this relationship up front.

          <h2>Capped T&amp;M</h2>
          <p>
            If risks are acceptable, we may allow a T&amp;M project to be capped so the project costs 
            do not exceed a pre-determined amount.  The cap will be assessed per project as a fixed 
            maximum estimate, calculated with respect to risks.  Since this method shifts the project 
            risk to us, there will be a contract prior to beginning that clearly identifies project 
            deliverables to protect against "scope creep".
