          <h2>Capped T&amp;M</h2>
          <p>
            For <strong>discrete projects with limited risk</strong>, we may agree to agree to cap a T&amp;M
            contract project such that the cost of the project will not exceed a pre-determined maximum
            for the project.  Capping the project cost transfers all of the financial risk to Starboard, 
            and as a result, the finished project cost will be slightly higher than the same project 
            billed as T&amp;M.
          </p>
          <p>Additional Features Of Capped T&amp;M Projects:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Rates are the same as the T&amp;M rates.</li>
            <li>Capped T&amp;M projects include a small up-front cost which offsets Starboard's risk 
              imposed by the cap.</li>
            <li>Capped T&amp;M Projects employ strict change management.</li>
            <li>Payment terms: 20% of cap at project start, remainder billed each week, net 15 days</li>

          <h2>Fixed Price</h2>
          <p>
            Also for <strong>discrete projects with limited risk</strong>, we may agree offer you a 
            Fixed Price for the project. This type of project contract offers you a known cost for a known 
            deliverable.
          </p>
          <p>Additional Features Of Fixed Price Projects:</p>
