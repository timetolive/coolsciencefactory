          Our goal is to establish a win-win relationship with our clients by establishing long-term 
          partnerships based on trust.  Our clients expect us to understand their goals, not just carry out
          instructions, and to make their budgets and schedules a priority.  Our partnership model is 
          designed to establish this relationship up front.

          <span class="h4 typeface-italic">We Guarantee Your Satisfaction</span>! 
          if you are unsatisfied at any point during your first partner contract, you may break the contract at any 
          point and your payment for unused hours will be refunded, no penalties, no questions asked!

          <h2>Time &amp; Materials (T&amp;M)</h2>
          <p>
            Outside of a partner agreement, T&amp;M projects are by far the most flexible and cost 
            the least for an overall project.  In order to get more flexibility and better rates, refer
            to our <a href="#partnerPlans">Partner Plans</a>.

          <h2>Capped T&amp;M</h2>
          <p>
            If risks are acceptable, we may allow a T&amp;M project to be capped so the project costs 
            do not exceed a pre-determined amount (the "cap").  As a result of the risk that the cap imposes
            on Starboard, the finished project cost is higher than the same project billed as T&amp;M.
            <ul>
              <li>Rates are the same as the T&amp;A rates.</li>
              <li>Capped T&amp;M projects include an additional up front billable effort to clarify the deliverables in the contract.</li>
              <li>Capped T&amp;M projects also include additional buffer hours which offset Starboard's risk imposed by the cap.</li>
              <li>Change orders will need to be drafted for each new effort, whether a new feature request, additional design iteration, etc.</li>
              <li>Change orders will be priced using the T&amp;A rates.</li>
              <li>Payment terms: 30% of cap at project start (which also includes the buffer hours), remainder billed each week, net 15 days</li>

          <h2>Fixed Price</h2>
          <p>
            If risks are acceptable, we may allow a Fixed Price project.  A Fixed Price project is 
            guaranteed to cost a pre-determined price based on Starboard's assessment, and Starboard 
            assumes the risks of unexpected project cost increases (excluding change orders). As a result, 
            the finished project cost is higher than the same project billed as T&amp;M or Capped T&amp;M.
            <ul>
              <li>Fixed Price projects include an additional up front billable effort to clarify the deliverables in the contract.</li>
              <li>Fixed Price projects should be expected to cost more for the entire project than the same project done using T&amp;M.</li>
              <li>Change orders will need to be drafted for each new effort, whether a new feature request, additional design iteration, etc.</li>
              <li>Change orders will be priced using the T&amp;A rates.</li>
